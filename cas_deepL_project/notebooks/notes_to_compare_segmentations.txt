1. Entropy (Measure of Class Diversity)

    What it measures: The randomness or diversity of classes in the segmentation mask.
    Why it's useful: Low entropy indicates a lack of diversity (e.g., one class dominates), which could suggest overconfidence in predictions.


2. Pixel Class Distribution

    What it measures: Counts the number of pixels per class in the segmentation mask.
    Why it's useful: Helps you understand if the model is biased toward certain classes.

3. Compactness (Spatial Consistency)

    What it measures: Checks if the predicted classes form compact regions rather than scattered or noisy predictions.
    Why it's useful: Compact masks are often indicative of good segmentation.

4. Region Count

    What it measures: Counts the number of contiguous regions for each class.
    Why it's useful: A high number of scattered regions could indicate noisy segmentation.

5. Segmentation Area (Proportion of Classes)

    What it measures: Calculates the proportion of the image area occupied by each class.
    Why it's useful: Helps validate if the proportions align with expected patterns.

6. Compare Across Multiple Masks

    Calculate metrics like entropy or area proportions for multiple masks in a category or split to find trends or anomalies.
